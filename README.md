# Pyramid Challenge
A little utility to ease
1. the 100 pushups challenge
1. the 100 pullups challenge (still working towards that)


For convenience a `tasks.py` file with helpful shortcuts is provided. (You will need to install invoke via `pip install invoke` first):
1. Use `inv build` to refresh the `main.js` file
